This repository contains those results derived from the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#)

I conducted the following steps to create the tinydata.txt result set.


#####STEP A:
Download data set from UCI & Prepare Working Folders [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/) and unzip files.
Establish working folders within R environment.


#####STEP B:
Combine train and test datasets into a single dataset retaining only the Means and Standard Deviation measures for Feature Vectors. 


#####STEP C:
Change the columns names to intuitive descriptive names


#####STEP D: 
Create new table of feature vector measure means for each subject and activity  


#####STEP E:
Write means of feature vector measures to tinydata.txt results file. 

There is Codebook that describes the data contained int he tinydata.txt result set.
